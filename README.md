# mdax-basefiles
This repository provides example basefiles for use in [MDAx](https://mdax.agile4.eu/app/).

Basefiles are "skeletons" of data schema used in a collaborative project to describe tool interfaces such as inputs and outputs.
They ussually lack node attributes, values, and mutliplicities.
